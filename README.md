# Boogie
**Version 1.0.0**

A Discord bot that can play music into voice chat. It was made as a replacement for the late Groovy.

---
## Setup
1. Install necessary packages.
2. Create `config.json` file for api keys (copy the format of `example_config.json`)
3. Run `run.bat`

I will not be hosting this bot regularly, so you will have to host it yourselves in order to use it.

## Commands
- `-ping`: will check if bot is working.
- `-play [song name/youtube url]`: play a song
- `-stop`: stop current song
- `-leave`: kick bot from voice chat
- `-pause`: pause song
- `-unpause`: unpause song
